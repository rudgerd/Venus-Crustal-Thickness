# Venus-Crustal-Thickness

## Discription
This analysis perform an inversion for a two-layered model of crust & mantle structure to model the Venusian crust[1]. This implemented model, assumes that the mass anomalies are affected by mass associated with (1) relief on the crust-mantle interface and (2) lateral variations in mantle density[2]. The resulting calculation subtracts the crust-mantle depth from the topography to make a crustal thickness map. I also explore using a much lower crustal density for the tessera terrain to see the effect this would have on the crustal thickness[3].

## Instructions
1. Add and name the following folders to the main folder in the follow order:
   SPHERICAL -> (LEGENDRE, KERNELC, GLMAPLHA)      
2. Run CrustThicknessMap.m
3. Explore different values for mean crustal thicknesses and densities
